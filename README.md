# klip

A straightforward client-side paste application written using Blazor WebAssembly

Klip compresses and encodes your content, which is then decoded from a URL. This way, should klip ever disappear, your paste is still available. Klip uses the DEFLATE algorithm for compression.

#### WebAssembly? For a paste app? Isn't that a bit overkill?

No u.
